# cyf-git-exercise

Before we start using git with our code, we want to familiarize ourselves with git concepts and commands.

## Movie Poster Shoot

At this point, you should have 6 photos from the "Movie Poster Shoot" exercise we did in class.

1. Photo 1: 2 actors start.

2. Photo 2: 2 additional actors join for a total of 4.

3. Photo 3: A prop for advertisement is added.

4. Photo 4: A famous celebrity joins for cameo role.

5. Photo 5: The famous celebrity drops out. Everyone poses with more exaggerated expression.

6. Photo 6: The famous celebrity from Pic 4 rejoins. Keep the exaggerated expressions from Pic 5.

## Homework

Your job is to re-create the 6 photos into 6 git commits.
Here are the requirements:
- Each character should be represented as a text file. For example, if you have a character named **Rose**, you would have a file named **rose.txt**
- Within each character's file, it should describe that character's state in the poster, e.g. **Rose is standing with her arms wide apart.**
- There should be a commit corresponding to each of the 6 photos above. Each commit message should describe what changed in the photo.
- Use git commands to make sure Photo 3 **branches** out to Photo 4 and Photo 5. Photo 6 should then be a **merge** of Photo 4 and Photo 5. 

Example is given in this repo.
